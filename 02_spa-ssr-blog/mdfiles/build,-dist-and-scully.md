# Build, dist and scully Static Site Generators

If we click on one of the blog items, we will navigate to the selected blog post. The content that is currently shown on the screen is a prerendered version of the blog post route.

To verify that, navigate to the dist folder of your Angular project, where you will find two folders:

    - my-blog: This contains the Angular live version of our application. When we execute the ng build Angular CLI command, it builds our application and outputs bundle files in this folder.

    - static: This contains a prerendered version of our Angular application generated from Scully when we run the npx scully --project my-blog command.

If we navigate to the static folder, we will see that Scully has created one folder for each route of our Angular application. Each folder contains an index.html file, which represents the component that is activated from that route.

The contents of the index.html file are auto-generated by Scully, and behave as if we run our application live and navigate to that component.

Now you can take your Angular application, upload it to the CDN or web server of your choice, and you will have your blog ready in no time! All you will have to do then will be to exercise your writing skills to create excellent blog content.
